## Introduction to Python Basics
  In this section, we will cover the fundamental concepts of Python programming, including syntax, variables, and data types.

# Python Syntax

Python is known for its clear and readable syntax. Here are some key points:

- Python uses indentation to define code blocks.
- Comments can be added using the `#` symbol.

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

# Variables

Variables are used to store data. In Python, you can create a variable by simply assigning a value to it.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
```

# Data Types

Python has several built-in data types. Here are the most common ones:

- **String**: Text data, enclosed in quotes.
- **Integer**: Whole numbers.
- **Float**: Decimal numbers.
- **Boolean**: Represents `True` or `False`.

```python
# Examples of data types
string_example = "Hello"
integer_example = 10
float_example = 10.5
boolean_example = True
```
