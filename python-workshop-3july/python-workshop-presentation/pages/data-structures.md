# Data Structures in Python

## Overview

Data structures are essential for organizing and storing data efficiently. In Python, we have several built-in data structures that allow us to manage data effectively.

---

## Lists

- **Definition**: A list is a mutable, ordered collection of items.
- **Syntax**: 
  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  ```
- **Key Operations**:
  - Adding items: `my_list.append(6)`
  - Removing items: `my_list.remove(3)`
  - Accessing items: `my_list[0]`  # returns 1

---

## Tuples

- **Definition**: A tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of items.
- **Syntax**: 
  ```python
  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
  ```
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Cannot be modified after creation.
  - Useful for fixed collections of items.

## Sets

- **Definition**: A set is an unordered collection of unique items.
- **Syntax**: 
  ```python
  my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
  ```
- **Key Operations**:
  - Adding items: `my_set.add(5)`
  - Removing items: `my_set.discard(2)`
  - Checking membership: `3 in my_set`  # returns True

---

## Dictionaries

- **Definition**: A dictionary is a mutable, unordered collection of key-value pairs.
- **Syntax**: 
  ```python
  my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
  ```
- **Key Operations**:
  - Adding items: `my_dict['city'] = 'New York'`
  - Accessing values: `my_dict['name']`  # returns 'Alice'
  - Removing items: `del my_dict['age']`

## Conclusion

Understanding these data structures is crucial for effective programming in Python. They provide the foundation for building complex data models and algorithms.
