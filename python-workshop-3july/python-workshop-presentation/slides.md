# Introduction

In this workshop, we will cover the following topics:
- Overview of Python programming language
- Key concepts and features
- Hands-on coding examples

---

# Python Basics

## Syntax and Variables

- Python uses indentation to define code blocks.
- Variables are created by assigning a value.

```python
# Example of variable assignment
name = "Python"
```

---

# Data Structures

## Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries

- **Lists**: Ordered and mutable collections.
- **Tuples**: Ordered and immutable collections.
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements.
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs for storing data.

```python
# Example of a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

---

# Functions

## Defining and Using Functions

- Functions are defined using the `def` keyword.
- They can take parameters and return values.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

---

# Modules

## Importing and Using Modules

- Modules are files containing Python code.
- Use the `import` statement to include them in your project.

```python
import math

# Using the math module
result = math.sqrt(16)
```
