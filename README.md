- Final challenge project
- Next steps for continued learning

## üöÄ How to Use This Workshop

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher installed
- Basic understanding of programming concepts (helpful but not required)

### Running the Examples

1. **Clone or download** the workshop files
2. **Navigate** to the workshop directory
3. **Run each file** to see the examples in action:

```bash
# Run individual topic files
python 01_python_syntax_overview.py
python 02_data_types_lists.py
python 03_data_types_dictionaries.py
# ... and so on
```

### Recommended Learning Path

1. **Start with syntax overview** to understand Python basics
2. **Work through data types** in order (lists ‚Üí dict ‚Üí sets ‚Üí tuples)
3. **Learn control flow** concepts (if ‚Üí for ‚Üí while)
4. **Master exception handling** for robust code
5. **Complete the exercises** to reinforce learning

## üí° Learning Tips

- **Run the code** - Don't just read, execute the examples!
- **Modify examples** - Change values and see what happens
- **Practice regularly** - Code a little bit every day
- **Ask questions** - Use comments to note unclear concepts
- **Build projects** - Apply concepts to real problems

## üéØ Workshop Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- ‚úÖ Write basic Python programs with proper syntax
- ‚úÖ Work with all major Python data types effectively
- ‚úÖ Use control flow to create dynamic programs
- ‚úÖ Handle errors gracefully with exception handling
- ‚úÖ Apply best practices for clean, readable code
